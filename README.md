# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Javascript

## Data Structures

1. **Linked List**:
   A linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, each containing a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

2. **Doubly Linked List**:
   Similar to a linked list, but each node also contains a reference to the previous node in addition to the next node.

3. **Stack**:
   A linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added and removed from the top of the stack.

4. **Queue**:
   A linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are added to the rear and removed from the front.

5. **Tree**:
   A hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node has a value and references to its child nodes, forming a parent-child relationship.

6. **Graph**:
   A non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect these nodes, representing relationships between entities.

7. **Hash Table**:
   A data structure that stores key-value pairs and uses a hash function to map keys to their associated values, allowing for efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion.

8. **Trie**:
   A tree-like data structure used for storing a dynamic set of strings, where each node represents a common prefix of the strings.

9. **Heap**:
   A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, which specifies the relationship between parent and child nodes, typically used to implement priority queues.

## Algorithms

1. **Recursion**:
   A programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.

2. **Sorting Algorithms**:
   Techniques for arranging elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.

3. **Searching Algorithms**:
   Techniques for finding an element or value within a data structure, including Linear Search, Binary Search, Depth-First Search (DFS), and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
